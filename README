Difficulty in my app is essentially the length of the game goes, how fast the next button is flashed.
based on the difficulty, and how fast the flash color changes.  The speed of the flash is a bit difficult to tell while
running but the difference is noticeable between Easy and Ultra

I  do not control how long a user has to make a selection.  I started to look into timer.schedule()
but I would need to find a way to restart the timer for each round.  If i had another few hours, I would go back to
add this.

I have the four colors implemented, each one flashes their own color.  The set grows as a user selects correctly.
Scores accumulate as long as the user wins the game.  The final score resets if the user loses a round.
A round is one pass as the color set grows.  A game is when the color set as reach maximum based on difficulty.

The difficulty selection, game board, and score screen are indepedent of each other's views.  I add and remove fragments
depending if the gameboard is active or if the score screen is active.  If user selects to play another game,
the score screen is removed and the difficulty selection screen is shown.

The gameboard screen shows when a difficutly is selected and Start is pressed.

I disable the start button when the round is going and the color buttons are disabled if the start button is clickable.
I found that if people get a bit "click happy" then you could send a lot animation requests that seemed to get processed
indepedent of each other with expected results.

Another issue i had was regrading updating the score text in view.
I tried multiple arranagments of sending the data via the Activity to the View and updating via function call but it
would crash.

I ended up sending the data to the view, stored in a variable, and then the view looks at that local variable
